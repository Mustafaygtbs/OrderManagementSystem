## Security

### Password Security

In the login panel, user passwords are securely stored using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. SHA-256,
a member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, is widely used for cryptographic hash functions.
This algorithm generates a fixed-length hash value from the data and is irreversible,
meaning the original data cannot be recovered from the hash. This enhances the security of passwords and helps protect sensitive information.
